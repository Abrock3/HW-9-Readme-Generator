## Description

This app assists developers with the somewhat tedious task of writing a detailed readme. It functions by prompting the user to answer some prompts about their project, and when the series of prompts is complete the app will assemble a file named READMEsample.md using the provided information. I learned quite a bit while creating this project; most notably I firmed up my knowledge of inquirer and node; I also learned the basics of the markdown language.

## Installation:

Prior to use, the user must install node, and run "npm i" from the command line.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, the user can run the application using "node index.js". Answer the prompts, and once it's complete look for READMEsample.md in your directory; this will be your assembled readme. Feel free to modify it after it's created if desired.

## Credits

I used this tutorial to learn how to replace all instances of a character in a string: https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-replace-character-inside-a-string-in-javascript.php

Some starter code was given to me by Trey Eckels, as this was an assignment given in the process of completing a full stack boot camp with Georgia Tech. It was simply empty functions, with sparse comments hinting at a general code structure.

Node.js was used in the creation and implementation of this app: https://nodejs.org/en/

Inquirer, a npm package, was used in the creation and implementation of this app: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer?ref=hackernoon.com

I have to credit my own app, for assisting me with creating this readme!
